To write do if not solving a problem in that day

** 04/07/2024: Add 2 number (Problem 2)
 - It seems like i started to understand the problem, for any changes on curr will affect dummy
 I think i gonna finish this problem again (by my own) the next day
 *Note: the main purpose of "update" is that when i have some reason for not solvin 1 problem per day, i will update at
 here the reason why.
 And yesterday, i kinda dont have mood to do anything so i dont commit any to git. That's all. See ya tomorrow

 ** 05/07/2024: Reverse Integer problem (Problem 7)
 - I have finished yesterday problem and redo it myself
 - Today this problem remind me of the limit of data type. Even i have finished the problem but it isnt fix with the demand of the
 problem which is using 32 bits integer (i use long and it is a 64 bits, i think it can be considered as 64 bits integer).
 So .... i gonna fix that later (later mean tomorrow)
 - Now i consider this package as a personal diary for my daily study (or my life)
